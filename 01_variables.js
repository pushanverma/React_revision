// let , var and const 


// var is used in old js version , where it had a problem of scope , it can be changed anywhere in the code which 
// introduced the problem of scoping 

// where let came in picture and let is block scoped , 

// we can store any type of value in (let and var ) since javsScript is dynamically typed language 

// whereas const is a type of variable which is fixed , its value cannot be changed , it is also blocked scoped.a

// Note : if we dont write any variable before variableName , js automatically initializes memory to it
